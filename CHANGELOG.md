# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Windows: lock tabs init on early steps of createWithTabs ([#1910](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/issues/1910))  
  This should prevent some cases of losing tabs structure on opening
  window by sidebery e.g. opening snapshot window or moving tabs to new window
- Search: minimum search query length in CJK should be 1. (by [@llc0930](https://github.com/llc0930): [#1985](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/issues/1985))  
  When the query string length is 1, check whether it is a CJK character.
- Keybindings: open all selected bookmarks (resolves [#1980](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/issues/1980))  
- Keybindings: expand selection range in bookmark sub-panel too
- Bookmarks: preserve customColor on opening bookmarks
- Drag and drop: insert new tab panel after the last tab/bkm panel
- Drag and drop: dropping tabs on unloaded bookmarks [sub-]panel
- Drag and drop: increase delay before resetting dropEventConsumed flag  
  This should decrease count of false-positive moving tabs to the
  new window, (when browser is too busy and time between drop and dragend
  events is more than 1500ms).
- Tabs: do not allow moving all tabs of window to the new one
- Drag and drop: increase min drag and drop duration before opening new window ([#1947](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery/issues/1947))  
  this should fix/reduce cases of false positive opening of a new window
  when sidebery doesn't get the ondrop event despite the cursor was over
  sidebar
- Drag and drop: increase deadline for requesting drop statuses from other sidebars
