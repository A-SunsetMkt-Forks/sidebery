Sidebery provides the list of tabs structured in a tree, bookmarks and history within the customizable panels. It aims to be fast and configurable.

<strong>Notice: </strong>Sidebery may conflict with addons that handle position of new tabs (e.g. Tree Style Tabs) or addons that move/sort tabs, which may result in unexpected behavior or broken tabs state at initialization. To avoid potential issues, please, disable such addons in Add-ons Manager page (about:addons).
